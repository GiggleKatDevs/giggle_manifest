Getting Started
---------------

To get started with GiggleKat, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the GiggleKat trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u https://github.com/GiggleKatDevs/giggle_manifest.git -b kitkat

Then to sync up:

    repo sync (-j4) (-j8) (-j16)- This depends on number of cpu cores- use just "repo sync" if you are unsure of what to use.

Please see any of the official beanstalk XDA threads for building instructions.
